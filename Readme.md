## Understand The Codebase 👨‍🏫

In this section We will discuss some important thing about codebase that might help you.

- **helper folder**: Like it's name this folder consists of helper files that will reduce our work like send mail, respones and crypto.

- **test folder**: Like it's name this folder consists of test files that will test our API every time you run ```npm run test``` command.

- **index.js file**: You can get the idea of the API from this file. You can read the comment of every api request like what data it should have in its body and What data it will return. (I will create a documentation of the API later).
